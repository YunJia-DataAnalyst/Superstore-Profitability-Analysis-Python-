### **Description of Dataset**

This analysis leverages the publicly available **Kaggle Superstore dataset**, a comprehensive collection of **over 10,000 sales transactions** from a global retailer. The analysis focused on the interplay of sales, profit (loss), quantity, and discount across regions, product categories, and customer segments.

### **Key Insights & Observations**
* **Identified Primary Drivers of Loss:** Statistical modeling revealed that **discount is the single most important factor** in predicting profit (loss), with an odds ratio of **237.07** in the logistic regression model, confirming its overwhelming impact.
* **Actionable Product Insights:** The analysis pinpointed specific sub-categories that are major drivers of loss, such as Tables and Bookcases, while also identifying protective factors like Binders and Paper that remain profitable even with high discounts.
* **Material Impact of Controls:** A simulation demonstrated that implementing strategic discount controls could lead to a **material increase in overall profitability**, showing how profit margins could grow from 11-14% to over 60% by moderating loss-driving transactions.
* **Segment-Specific Performance:** Findings showed that profitability differs across customer segments, with the Corporate segment proving to be more profitable than the Home Office segment, offering a clear target for future strategies.

### **Technical Process & Deliverables**
I performed this analysis in **Python**, using libraries such as **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation. The project included a range of technical and analytical steps:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed initial analysis using pairplots to identify anomalies and relationships, such as the strong negative correlation between discount and profit.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Built a **decision tree model** to identify the key drivers of profit (loss) and ran a **logistic regression** to validate the most significant factors.
* **Actionable Outputs:** The final deliverable included actionable recommendations to optimize pricing policies and generated **Excel files of all loss-making transactions** for targeted action by regional managers.
