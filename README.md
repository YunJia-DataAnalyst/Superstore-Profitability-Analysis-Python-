### **Description of Dataset**

This analysis leverages the publicly available **Kaggle Superstore dataset**, a comprehensive collection of **over 10,000 sales transactions** from a global retailer. The analysis focused on key variables including sales, profit, quantity, discount, and various categorical dimensions like region and product sub-category.

### **Key Insights & Observations**
* **Discounts as a Key Driver:** Statistical modeling revealed that **discount is overwhelmingly the most important factor** in predicting profit (loss), with a 94% importance score in the decision tree model.
* **Material Impact of Controls:** A simulation demonstrated that implementing strategic discount controls could lead to a material increase in overall profitability while sustaining revenue growth.
* **Concentration of Losses:** The analysis identified specific high-risk areas, such as the Tables sub-category, which consistently generated more loss-making transactions than profitable ones.
* **Profitability Varies by Segment:** Findings showed that profitability differs across customer segments, with the Corporate segment proving to be a more profitable focus area.

### **Technical Process & Deliverables**
I performed this analysis in Python, using libraries such as Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation. The project included a range of technical and analytical steps:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed initial analysis using pairplots to identify anomalies and relationships, such as the strong negative correlation between discount and profit.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Built a decision tree model to identify the key drivers of profit (loss) and ran a logistic regression to validate the most significant factors, such as specific product sub-categories.
* **Actionable Outputs:** The final deliverable included actionable recommendations to optimize pricing policies and generated Excel files of all loss-making transactions for targeted action by regional managers.
